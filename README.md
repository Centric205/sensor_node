# sensor_node
PART 2 OF PRACTICAL 6

The Sensor Node Docker Container is for Pi-01.
  - The raspberry pi here is connected to a circuit on the breadboard via the GPIO pins
  - The circuit has sensors that allow the Pi to communicate with the external world.
  - These sensors are the LDR which is a photoresistor and the MCP008 Temperature sensor.
 
 The container was then deployed to Balena cloud.
